    <h2 class="title sub-headers">Description</h2>
    <p>
        There are all kinds of tasty add-ins to risotto, and mushrooms are just one of them. Mushrooms add an earthy,
        savory flavor to risotto that makes it a good complement to main dishes like roast chicken, pork, or beef. You
        can serve mushroom risotto as a side dish, a main dish, or a starter to a multi-course Italian menu.

    <h2 class="title sub-headers">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups chicken broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 medium shallots, diced</li>
        <li>1 Â½ cups Arborio rice</li>
        <li>Half cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped chives</li>
        <li>Half cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="title sub-headers">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add portobello and white mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots and cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated with oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter, chives, and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
